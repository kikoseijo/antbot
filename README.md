Antbot
======

This open source project comes from the need to run several [Passivbot](https://www.passivbot.com/) ***"A fully automated trading bot"*** on same server, with multiple exchanges with infinite trading accounts & APIs.

A Multi-tenancy architecture allows you to have your friends and family running their own crypto trading bots without any knowledge of Shell or Programming Skills because everything its database driven & managed trough a website.

At same time, this application its able to monitor and interact with the Python crypto bots and comes with exchange scrapper thats able to pull your trades historic data and give you full control over your assets, incomes & bot performance.

The application its developed using the [TALL stack](https://tallstack.dev/), uses Tailwind, Alpine.js, Laravel, and Livewire to achieve a Reactive full-stack solution.

***Important notes:***

- It's a Beta version.
- It's under ~~heavy~~ development.
- You need a knowledge installing Laravel + Installing Python applications and environments.

## Roadmap

New features can be easily achieve with little effort, being based on a full stack for fast development.
Many features can be implemented but the main ones right now are the following:

- [X] Bybit exchange scrapper.
- [ ] Binance exchange scrapper.
- [x] Bitget exchange scrapper.
- [ ] OKX exchange scrapper.
- [ ] Dockerize application.

- [x] What2Trade + [Direcctional Scalper](https://github.com/donewiththedollar/directional-scalper).

## Python crypto bots

### Passivbot

Follow [Passivbot](https://www.passivbot.com/) installation guide, its better if you try to run a bot as indicated before linking into Antbot.

...

## Docker install (Comming Soon, under development)

Setup instructions:

```
git clone git@github.com:kikoseijo/antbot.git
cd antbot
cp .env.example .env
sed -i 's#^APP_KEY=.*$#APP_KEY=base64:'`openssl rand -base64 32`'#g' .env
ln -s ../storage/app/public public/storage
docker-compose up -d
```

Update image with new code (including database migration):

`docker-compose up -d --build`

The data of `mysql` and `redis` is saved in those paths respectively:

`antbot/docker/mysql/volume`
`antbot/docker/redis/volume`

## Web server deployment

Antbot its a PHP + MYSQL application, can be run on any webserve, vps, etc.
Use this guide as an example for remote deployment, adjust accord.

#### Download and install

You can use this piece of script as an example of what steps are needed for installing Antbot.

```bash
ssh user@yourserver
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:kikoseijo/antbot.git
cd antbot
composer install --no-dev
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan storage:link
```

Docker equivalent:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:kikoseijo/antbot.git
cd antbot
cp .env.example .env
sed -i 's#^APP_KEY=.*$#APP_KEY=base64:'`openssl rand -base64 32`'#g' .env
ln -s ../storage/app/public public/storage
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Configure your enviroment variables

The `.env` file created in previous step needs your information for database, email and paths for bots to work.
Email configuration its important, application should be able to send emails at certain moments.

```bash
DB_DATABASE=antbot
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=yorupassword
...
PYTHON_PATH="python3"
PASSIVBOT_PATH="/path/to/passivbot"
PASSIVBOT_LOGS_PATH="/path/to/logs_folder"
...
MAIL_USERNAME=null
MAIL_PASSWORD=null
```

Run the following command: for changes to be effective.

```bash
php artisan config:clear
```

#### Publish application

Please note the root of your webserver should be a folder called `public` inside Antbot installation folder.

```bash
cd ~
rm -rf public_html
ln -s ~/antbot/public ~/public_html
echo "App should be now live."
```

You are now ready to go, navigate to your new application url and register the first user (First user will be created as Admin).

#### Cronjob

Exchange scrapper needs a CronJob to run every minute, this will maintaine bots running even after reboots and keep exchanges up to date.

```bash
* * * * * cd /path/to/antbot && /opt/remi/php81/root/usr/bin/php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

### Configure Passivbot default grids

Passivbot comes with 3 [run modes](https://www.passivbot.com/en/latest/passivbot_modes/), its best starting point for someone new to Passivbot.
You can leave this settings as default, just make sure the files linked are available inside Passivbot installation.
You will also be able to create and edit your own grids directly from the control panel.

```php
'grid_configs' => [
    'recursive' => 'configs/live/recursive_grid_mode.example.json',
    'neat' => 'configs/live/neat_grid_mode.example.json',
    'static' => 'configs/live/static_grid_mode.example.json',
],
```



## Updates


For updating antbot you can follow this steps, its not a zero downtime deployment, but we dont need such advance feature because bots are run separately from the application.

```bash
cd ~/antbot
php artisan down --render="errors::503" --refresh=10
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
git pull origin master
composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader --ignore-platform-reqs
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan config:clear
php artisan config:cache
php artisan view:clear
php artisan view:cache
php artisan up
```
